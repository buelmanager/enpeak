The musical score was amazing, the animation was very well done, and the story was simply enchanting.\n#Person2#: I think otherwise. Even though the animation was technically strong, and as you say, the score and songs performed by Elton John were great, the film lacks a certain originality ; it lacked heart.

It did have some very dramatic and intense scenes. For example when Mufasal dies, or the dark, grim portrayal of Scar. Even so, the film is linear. Mufasal dies, Simba runs away thinking it's his fault. Falls in love and returns to retake what is rightfully his. It's just too cliche.\n#Person1#: How can it be cliche? It's a fable! It's telling a time-honoured story!

We were together for 3 years.\n#Person2#: So why'd you split up? If you don't mind my asking. \n#Person1#: Not at all. We just started to drift apart, different interests, different plans for the future. The breakup was mutual.\n#Person2#: Ah, that's great. My last relationship was a nightmare, I hooked up with a guy at a New Year's party and we were together for six months, but we were constantly fighting and making up. I don't know how I put up with him for so long.\n#Person1#: How'd it end? \n#Person2#: He cheated on me, I caught him making out with his ex. He begged me for another chance, but I know he was just trying to jerk me around, so I said no.\n#Person1#: Ugh! Good for you. \n#Person2#: Thanks. So how about you, are you going out with anyone at the moment?\n#Person1#: Oh, I've gone on a few dates here and there, but nothing serious. To be honest, I'm not really interested in settling down just yet, I'm enjoying the single life too much.",

We mostly need kitchen utensils, bathroom accessories, cleaning and laundry accessories--things like that.

Do you know about that?\n#Person2#: I have never shopped there, but I think Price Club is a kind of membership store.\n#Person1#: What does that mean?\n#Person2#: That means you have to pay a membership fee to shop there. I have heard they have very good prices on electronics.\n#Person1#: Electronics?\n#Person2#: Yes. Like stereos and televisions.\n#Person1#: How much is the membership fee?\n#Person2#: I'm not sure.

They work at different places in the kitchen and follow recipes. In contrast, chefs have special training and understand better which food goes well together, so they can invent new recipes.\n#Person1#: I see, a chef is the cook, who has completed a professional course while a cook it's basically any person who cooks food. By the way, how do you become a chef?\n#Person2#: I am trained. 95% is about professional training and the other 5% is about talent.\n#Person1#: Would you mind describing us a day of a chef? We're so curious about that.\n#Person2#: Nothing special, I generally go to work 2 hours before service starts. The night before, I've written the lists of all the things we need to prepare the next day. I work in different roles depending on what is needed.\n#Person1#: Challenging. How long do you work everyday?\n#Person2#: 10 to 12 hours a day.\n#Person1#: An almost full time job! Do you have any tips for average cooks, like me?\n#Person2#: Cooking involves your passion and creativity. Kitchen is never a place to chop vegetables, and have a quick breakfast. It is good to make food that people really enjoy.\n#Person1#: I can't agree with you more. Miracles happen in the kitchen. Thanks for joining us, David.\n#Person2#: My pleasure.",

That is very fast. Others aren't so fast.\n#Person2#: Have you seen a lot of them?\n#Person1#: I've only seen one in my life. I was looking out the window. It was around two miles away. It was very interesting to watch. But it was heading toward my friend's house. So I quickly called them on the phone.\n#Person2#: Did it hit their house?\n#Person1#: No, it didn't. But they are glad I called them.\n#Person2#: What were they doing when you called?\n#Person1#: They were all sitting in the living room watching TV. They had no idea a tornado was coming toward their house. If it had hit them, they could have all been killed.\n#Person2#: That's terrible. Do many people die in tornadoes?\n#Person1#: Not so many really. But a lot of houses are destroyed sometimes.",

We are currently overstocked and overstaffed and our profits arefalling fast. The market is in recession and we have no way of moving our inventory, or getting rid of our staff. If we consider redundancies, it would cost us a fortune because of the new regulations governing compensation packages. It's a real mess. \n#Person1#: For crying out loud. . . How fast are we losing money? \n#Person2#: Um. . . how can I put this? Let's just say that at this pace, we will be filing for Chapter eleven in less than three months. \n#Person1#: What! Geez! How could this have happened? So what's the bad news? \n#Person2#: Oh, that's the really bad news. Our supplier suffered QC problems and, well, half of our production is faulty. We're going to have to recall all itemssold in the last quarter. And the worst part? We're going to have to shoulder this cost. \n#Person1#: Are you joking? Get the supplier on the line now! They have to assume the costs of this mess! \n#Person2#: We tried that, sir. The factory has gone under and the owner apparently has fled the country. \n#Person1#: We're doomed! \n#Person2#: There is some really good news though! \n#Person1#: Really? What! \n#Person2#: I got offered a new job! ",

Most important of all is that she seems to have a better memory than average.\n#Person1#: Have you had any experience with computer?\n#Person2#: Yes, I studied in a computer training program, and can process data through the computer.\n#Person1#: That's fine. What about operating the fax and duplicator?\n#Person2#: I can handle them without any trouble\n#Person1#: What have you learned from jobs you have held?\n#Person2#: Above all, I have learned that what is good for the company is good for me. So I follow the instructions strictly and always keep my boss informed.\n#Person1#: Very good.",

Is it a big deal if we are no longer manufacturing these cars, Malcolm?\n#Person2#: I think it's a huge deal. I mean the companies are massive employers both directly and indirectly. If you look at Ford after their restructuring, they've actually got 87,000 employees which is twice as many as Microsoft have worldwide. Moreover, if you look at those jobs, they are very high-paying jobs. These are people who can afford to buy their own products.\n#Person1#: Er, it seems to indicate a big hit for our economy if these jobs go bye-bye.\n#Person2#: Yeah, it's a really sad day for America.\n#Person1#: But it is not as if cars are stopped being made, right?\n#Person2#: Correct. Still a large number of cars are being made by American manufacturers. More than half of the American cars sold in America are American. So what has happened over time is that as the market share has fallen, foreign car companies have come in, taken over plants and set up new plants, and they have taken over that capacity. So, it is not like there are fewer cars being produced in America than there were 30 years ago.\n#Person1#: Let me ask you about the Chinese coming in. What would it mean to American jobs, if and when that happens?\n#Person2#: The Chinese cars we have seen so far aren't that great and they don't have the branding necessary to make a huge impact in the world stage.",

That is, so different things get in their way and people don't stand up for their goals. They don't struggle for them. They let other forces push them around a little bit. Also, a lot of people don't set goals; they think they do. But it's either a dream of very loose goal. So when they have to make a decision about a necessary action in their life the goal is so far back in their mind that they don't act in its best interest.

    "content": "#Person1#: Today on mind matters, I'm talking to Dr. Ann Winters, an expert on human memory.. Ann, welcome to the program. Now, I suppose the first question everyone would ask is: what exactly is human memory?\n#Person2#: Well, like so many easy questions, the answer isn't very simple. Basically, human memory is a compartment in people's brains where they store images rather like the hard disc drive in a computer. And like a hard disc drive, our memories can become infected or even wiped out by accidents. But the comparison breaks down when we consider that we can train our memories to expand and work better which computers can't manage yet.\n#Person1#: When you talk about memory being infected, do you mean by a disease?\n#Person2#: Yes. For instance, people suffering from a physiological disease like Alzheimer: forget things that happened in the past. And they also forget how to perform simple tasks like tying their shoelaces. The good news is that brain exercises can help keep the brain young. Research has shown that people who have better educations and more mentally active jobs have a lower risk of developing the disease.\n#Person1#: And how can someone exercise his brain? By thinking a lot?\n#Person2#: In a way, yes. But you can also practice using your memory which not only exercises your brain but also improves you ability to remember things. Unfortunately, a lot of devices in modern life are designed to make sure we don't forget things which can make our brains more idle and weaken our memories.\n#Person1#: Can you give us some examples of how to exercise our memories?\n#Person2#: Sure, there is a very simple technique, although it works better for some people than for others. When you want to remember something, think of a physical thing it reminds you of. If I want to remember a date from history, let's say, 1066, the date of the Battle of Hastings. I might think that battle reminds me of bottle, so I think of a bottle with the number 1066 written on the label. And I just picture that bottle to myself.",

Sounds good, but none of my test scores were that high, so I don't know how I got a decent grade.\n#Person1#: That's probably because he grades on a curve.\n#Person2#: Are you enjoying the class so far?\n#Person1#: I hate it and I was about to withdrawal. But after hearing your experience, I think I will tough it out.\n#Person2#: Yes. Definitely stay in the class. You will get a better grade than your test scores. He does that deliberately to make all the students study a lot.\n#Person1#: Thanks for letting me know. I feel relieved now.",

I should say just over an hour.\n#Person1#: So what are the two main times of the day that you watch TV?\n#Person2#: Well, a little around breakfast time and then it tends to be really late eleven or even midnight- when I've finished work.\n#Person1#: And what sort of programmes do you go for?\n#Person2#: Some news bulletins but I also really like to put my feet up with some of the old comedy shows.\n#Person1#: Fine. And turning to the new channel..., which type of programmes would you like to see more of?\n#Person2#: Well, I certainly don't think we need any more factual programmes like news and documentaries. I think we need more about things like local information..., you know, providing a service for the community. And in the same vein, perhaps more for younger viewers..., you know, good quality stuff.\n#Person1#: Ah ha. And if you had to give the new directors some specific advice when they set up the channel, what advice would you give them?\n#Person2#: I think I'd advise them to pay a lot of attention to the quality of the actual broadcast, you know, the sound system. People are very fussy these days about that and in general I think they ought to do lots more of these kinds of interview, you know, talking with their potential customers.\n#Person1#: Oh, I'm glad you think it's valuable!\n#Person2#: Certainly... yeah.\n#Person1#: Good. OK, this will be a commercial channel of course, but how often do you think it is tolerable to have adverts?\n#Person2#: Well, out of that list I'd say every quarter of an hour. I don't think we can complain about that, as long as they don't last tot ten minutes each time!\n#Person1#: Quite. And would you be willing to attend any of our special promotions for the new channel?\n#Person2#: Yes, I'd be very happy to, as long as they're held here in my area.\n#Person1#: OK, I'll make a note of that. And finally, may we put you on our mailing list?\n#Person2#: Well, I'd prefer not..., except for the information about the promotion you mentioned.\n#Person1#: Can I have your name and address?\n#Person2#: Of course ... here's my card.\n#Person1#: Oh, lovely..., and thank you very much for your time and we look forward to seeing you.\n#Person2#: Yes, indeed.

He's here to talk about the recent report, stating that by 2050 Brazil will be the one ot the word's wealthiest and most successful countries. Alberto, what do you say to the report?\n#Person2#: You know this isn't the first time that people are saying Brazil will be a great economic power. The same thing was said over a hundred year ago. But it didn't happen.\n#Person1#: Yes, but you must admit the world's a very different place now.\n#Person2#: Of course. In fact I believe there's maybe some truth in the prediction this time around. First of all, though, we must remember the problems facing Brazil at the moment.\n#Person1#: Such as...?\n#Person2#: There's an enormous gap between the rich and the poor in this country. In Sal Paulo, you can see shopping malls full of designer goods right next door to the slam areas without proper water and electricity supplies. A lot of work needs to be done to help people in those areas improve their lives.\n#Person1#: What needs to be done?\n#Person2#: Education, for example. For Brazil to be successful, we need to offer education to all Brazilians. Successful countries like South Korea and Singapore have excellent education systems. Brazil needs to learn from these countries.\n#Person1#: So you are hopeful for the future.\n#Person2#: As I said earlier, I'm hopeful. This isn't an easy job.

I think a still more desirable benefit is psychological. Bicycling home after work can help release your stress. Life in the offices is miserable.

He said she makes really good sushi. \n#Person1#: Hmm, that's a bit of a challenge. Sushi is notoriously difficult to pair with wine. Well, let's see. have to be a white wine, of course. \n#Person2#: Why? Wouldn't a red wine go well with sushi? \n#Person1#: No, I don't think so. Sushi is a very delicately flavored food, and red wine would be a jarring contrast. You need a white wine, which has more subtle flavors, to complement the fish. \n#Person2#: I see. So should I get a bottle of Chardonnay? That's a white wine, right? \n#Person1#: Yes, Chardonnay is a white wine, but I'm not sure it'd be your best bet. Chardonnay is one of the more fullbodied whites, and tends to be a bit oaky. I'd suggest that you go for something brighter, like this Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand. \n#Person2#: Sauvignon Blanc? What's that? \n#Person1#: That's another varietal, or type of grape, just like Chardonnay. \n#Person2#: Let's see.

We don't have quite as extensive a selection over here, but. . . this Rhone Valley white would be lovely. \n#Person2#: All right. What varietal is that? \n#Person1#: Well, this is a French wine, so they don't always specify the varietal on the label. The French believe that the soil a grape is grown in is one of the most important factors in the final flavor of the wine. This wine is probably a blend of a few different types of grapes, mostly Viognier, I'd guess. \n#Person2#: And you think this is a good wine? \n#Person1#: Yes, this is one of our best-sellers. It's not quite as dry as the Sauvignon Blanc we were looking at earlier, which means it's more approachable. It's light and crisp, with a bit of a vanilla aroma. \n#Person2#: Perfect! I'll take it!

Are we ready, Ashley? [Ready to eat.] No, let's wait for a few minutes. We'll get to that. But as you know, my faithful listeners, I starting cooking and baking almost 30 years ago when my grandmother taught me in her humble kitchen. In fact, she taught almost me everything I know, and I've never attended cooking classes [You should have ...] Wait, wait, wait ... I know my daughter's going to mention to you faithful listeners that recently as I was helping the kids prepare for our kitchen for chicken meal, I forgot to take the chicken out of the oven, burned the bird to a crisp, and we ended up ordering pizza for dinner.\n#Person2#: We had to use the fire extinguisher.\n#Person1#: But that's another story. So, anyway, today I'd like to share with you our favorite ... at least my favorite ... chocolate chip cookie recipe. Now, before you switch the TV channel, I know what you are thinking. 'Another fattening cookie recipe.' But wait. What makes this recipe great is that it offers a wonderful low-fat, low-calorie, low-cholesterol dessert for the entire family.\n#Person2#: We still like the fat though.\n#Person1#: Well, I know we do. But let's see. We have all the ingredients, so we can start by mixing all of the ingredients, the sugars, the flour, the egg whites, the low-fat butter, vanilla, baking soda, and a pinch of salt in a large mixing bowl. Then, we add the mini chocolate chips. Now, my kids would like me to add the big ones but we start with the mini-chocolate chips. And don't forget to preheat the oven to 350 degrees (Fahrenheit). And finally, when the cookies are done, take them out of the oven, remove them from the cookie sheet, and let them cool before their fingers get into them. Did I forget anything?\n#Person2#: Yeah, if you have college-age kids, be sure to make a few extra batches they can take back to school for their roommates. And don't forget the kids still at home.\n#Person1#: Oh, well yeah. We can't do that. We can't forget them. And unfortunately, by the time your kids get the cookies, you, the cook, will be left with a single cookie - your instant diet plan for you - and a dirty kitchen. So, that's all for today. On next week's show, we will be showing you how to feed hungry teenagers on a budget without having to sell the family car. Until then.",

How do you counter that?\n#Person2#: First of all, most of us hear about premarital contracting when someone rich and famous gets divorced and about all the battles they are going through. I know when my husband and I decided that we wanted to have a premarital contract, my son said 'Why you guys doing that? Don't you trust each other?' So it's not surprising that people's initial reaction is a negative one. But in fact, premarital contracting is a way that we can learn more about each other, make each other feel more comfortable about issues that are of concerns, and certainly clarify money concerns. This way, we can talk about them, decide together how we want our marriage to work, and if necessary, and only if necessary, we put it in a premarital contract, a legal document.\n#Person1#: Each year, there is one divorce for every two marriages. And a substantial portion of those who have divorced remarry. Is the notion of the premarital contract simply for those who are entering second marriages, or is it also something for the people getting married for the first time?\n#Person3#: Premarital contracting is a communication process. I think all of us, whatever age we are, whatever financial status we have, we have things to talk about. And if we avoid doing that and wait until there are problems, it's almost too late.

I go there and order big breakfast and take one of their newspapers and just relax for an hour or so. Their pancakes are delicious. They don't have a TV in there, which I love most.

There are only about 6 tables in there, a couple of waitresses wear ugly pink uniforms. But the food is great, very tasty and cheap too, which is important of course. There are some truck drivers sitting at the counter drinking coffee. And eating sausages every morning. I always have pancakes in the morning, and their fish pie for lunch.
